# climate-policy-impacts
This repository contains all the code necessary to reproduce the analysis including the figures of our recent work on the distributional impact of price instruments vs. regulatory instruments in the German mobility sector.

You need to assemble all the scripts and the datasets used in one directory to run the analysis. Then run the master_distributional_impacts.R script to produce the figures. To study the code in detail, look into the run_analysis.R script to see how results were derived. To study how the figures are created, look into the create_plots.R script. 

The methodological_summary.pdf file gives a concise description of our methodology.
